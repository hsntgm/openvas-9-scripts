# openvas-9-scripts

## first-start --> 
This is OpenVAS first-start/check-setup script which make things automatically for first time use.
Primarily written for Gentoo/Linux but i hope it will do the job for the other distros.

## openvas-feed-sync --> 
Cron script for updating OpenVAS feeds.

    Inspect the scripts. You never blindly run scripts you
    downloaded from the Internet, do you?
